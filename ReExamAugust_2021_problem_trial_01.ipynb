    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 5 problems each worth 8 points for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "15 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Some problems are similar to the exam in January but changed.\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam has no anonymous exam ID due to a technical issue, however this does not mean\n",
    "that the exam is not anonymous. The grading system will automatically download all the exams from Studium\n",
    "and it is at this stage that they are anonymized by a randomized ID.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "* I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not use encrypted communications\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",

    "## Good luck!\n"
